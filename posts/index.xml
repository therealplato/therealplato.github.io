      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Achievements: I tried Amazon Lambda. I first heard of this &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo; computing at Full Stack Fest 2016.

I immediately observed that there are, in fact, still servers involved, you&amp;rsquo;re just delegating operations to Amazon.
After I got over my pedantry and listened to this story I decided I liked the idea. Lambda can be orders of magnitudes cheaper than EC2 (for sporadic resource use,) or more expensive than EC2 (for pegged resource use.</description>

      <description>Keep catching myself reaching for my e-cig, locked far away.

      <description>Wut? Joe Rogan Experience #1007 introduced the Sober October challenge. I realized I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time I went a week without a beer. I&amp;rsquo;m certainly dependent on nicotine, I wonder if I am dependent on alcohol? Let&amp;rsquo;s find out.
Goal: Produce something useful each day this month instead of getting drunk and sucking at rocket league.
Rules: Caffiene is allowed.
Every other psychoactive substance is disallowed including nicotine and alcohol.</description>
