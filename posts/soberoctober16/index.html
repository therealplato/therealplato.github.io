                    <p>Today my colleague delivered the 3D print of my <a href="/posts/soberoctober09/">day 9</a> STL file. We printed it at approximately 20mm*20mm*4mm to verify that I got everything right. Other than orienting Y-axis up instead of correct Z-axis up, the scale and mesh were fine and produced a print with excellent fine detail. Now I&rsquo;m working on the full scale project, which will be a sign for the company dishwasher.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting stronger with my kettlebell. Week one was 50 swings each morning, week two was 60, today I&rsquo;ve bumped it to 75. My original
ambition of 100 swings in week 2 was ambitious. I think these counts are about right; each Monday I have felt some mild aches in lower back about 8
hours after the workout (but no pains during or immediately after the workout), the aches are gone by Thursday.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve updated the nav bar on this site, learning the basics of CSS Flexbox in the process. I&rsquo;ve added previous/next links between posts, kept the nav visible while scrolling, and reflowed it at low
screen resolutions. Seems that modifying other people&rsquo;s CSS is more difficult than writing your own&hellip;</p>
